# TODO while Development
1. Route-based code-splitting. (https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#route-based-code-splitting)
2. This website will be pretty image heavy. so need to adopt the idea of lazy-loading of images for performance.
3. Make the app intensively based on the Redux store but make use of the Context API in as many places as we can.
